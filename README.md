# VK Terrain Demo

The Vk Terrain Demo is my first project involving Vulkan and started as a curiosity and potential portfolio piece.

# The Demo

The Demo when complete will be a procedural terrain demo with interactive elements, running across multiple threads and demonstrating realtime changes. Its intention is only a proof of functionality in the Vulkan tools used to develop it.

# VKCPP

VKCPP is the Vulkan tools used to develop the demo, it is intended to be an exercise in API and rendering engine design. In strict terms, VKCPP is a C++ Wrapper for Vulkan providing RAII compliant classes for vulkan functionality.

VKCPP is intended to extend to multiple abstraction layers, gradually taking control of various aspects of rendering, an end state of which would be a feature complete rendering pipeline, though such a scope is a far cry from the projects current stage.
